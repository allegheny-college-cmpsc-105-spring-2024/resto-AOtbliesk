Apparently, my ice cream shop went viral - it is popular in Arab Emirates now!

Google Analytics is pretty useful tool to track the traffic of your website. It is easy to use and very informative. It also does not require any programming skills - which makes it accessible to a wider range of users. During this lab I had most of the website visitors on the day of the lab - which means that the website is not popular at all ;) however, I learned how to use the GA, which is definitely something beneficial. Surprisingly, I also had a user from Arab Emirates, who, I believe was a student just using emirati ip address, nevertheless, I think if I ever have to operate website of a company, the data about the countries will be very useful for the potential analysis.
I also thing that first user channel group bar is can be potentially very useful for marketing purposes, as we can analyze where customers are coming from. The same can be said aout the popularity of certain pages - we can easily track what people are interested in.
