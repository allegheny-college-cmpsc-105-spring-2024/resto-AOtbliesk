"iScream isn't just an ice cream shop – it's a destination. From the outside, it may look like your typical neighborhood scoop joint, but step inside, and you'll discover a world of flavor and fun that's unlike anything you've ever experienced. Rory and Nia have truly outdone themselves with this gem of a shop. The moment you walk in, you're greeted with the intoxicating aroma of freshly made waffle cones and the sight of an awe-inspiring array of ice cream flavors that span the spectrum from classic to creative. As a self-proclaimed ice cream aficionado, I pride myself on my discerning palate, and let me tell you, iScream did not disappoint. Each scoop is a work of art, meticulously crafted to perfection. I found myself torn between trying old favorites and venturing into uncharted territory with their unique flavor offerings. In the end, I settled on a scoop of dark chocolate truffle and a scoop of lavender honey – a combination that sent my taste buds into a state of pure ecstasy. But what truly sets iScream apart is the passion and dedication of Rory, Nia, and their team. It's clear that they pour their hearts and souls into every batch of ice cream they churn, and their enthusiasm is infectious. Whether you're a die-hard ice cream enthusiast or just looking for a sweet treat to brighten your day, do yourself a favor and pay a visit to iScream. I guarantee it'll be an experience you won't soon forget."
