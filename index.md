Founded in 2005 by childhood friends and ice cream aficionados, Rory and Nia, iScream started as a humble scoop shop in the heart of a bustling downtown. With a shared passion for crafting delectable frozen treats and a dream of bringing joy to their community, Rory and Nia poured their hearts and souls into building their beloved ice cream haven.

In the early days, they experimented tirelessly in their tiny kitchen, concocting unique flavor combinations and perfecting their recipes until they achieved ice cream perfection. Word quickly spread about their heavenly creations, and soon, locals and tourists alike were lining up around the block for a taste of iScream's irresistible scoops.

As the years passed, iScream blossomed into a beloved institution, cherished for its commitment to quality, creativity, and customer service. Rory and Nia expanded their menu to include an array of tantalizing flavors, from timeless classics to bold, innovative creations that pushed the boundaries of conventional ice cream.

Despite its growth and success, iScream has remained true to its roots, maintaining the same warm, welcoming atmosphere that made it a neighborhood favorite from the start. Today, as Rory and Nia look back on their journey, they are filled with gratitude for the loyal patrons who have supported them every step of the way. With each scoop served, iScream continues to spread joy and sweetness, one delighted customer at a time.
