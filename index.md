Founded in 2005 by childhood friends and ice cream aficionados, Rory and Nia, iScream started as a humble scoop shop in the heart of a bustling downtown. With a shared passion for crafting delectable frozen treats and a dream of bringing joy to their community, Rory and Nia poured their hearts and souls into building their beloved ice cream haven.

In the early days, they experimented tirelessly in their tiny kitchen, concocting unique flavor combinations and perfecting their recipes until they achieved ice cream perfection. Word quickly spread about their heavenly creations, and soon, locals and tourists alike were lining up around the block for a taste of iScream's irresistible scoops.

As the years passed, iScream blossomed into a beloved institution, cherished for its commitment to quality, creativity, and customer service. Rory and Nia expanded their menu to include an array of tantalizing flavors, from timeless classics to bold, innovative creations that pushed the boundaries of conventional ice cream.

Despite its growth and success, iScream has remained true to its roots, maintaining the same warm, welcoming atmosphere that made it a neighborhood favorite from the start. Today, as Rory and Nia look back on their journey, they are filled with gratitude for the loyal patrons who have supported them every step of the way. With each scoop served, iScream continues to spread joy and sweetness, one delighted customer at a time.

The variety of flavors is truly impressive, catering to every palate imaginable. I couldn't resist trying the classic favorites like chocolate fudge and vanilla bean, but I also ventured into more adventurous territory with their unique creations like lavender honey and salted caramel pretzel. Each scoop was rich, creamy, and bursting with flavor. The staff were friendly and knowledgeable, offering recommendations and samples to help me find my perfect match. Whether you're a die-hard ice cream enthusiast or just looking for a sweet treat to brighten your day, iScream is the place to be!" - Violet Purpleplum


"iScream exceeded all my expectations! As a self-proclaimed ice cream connoisseur, I'm always on the hunt for the next big thing in frozen desserts, and let me tell you, iScream delivers in spades. The ambiance is charming and cozy, making it the perfect spot to indulge in a guilty pleasure or two. What truly sets them apart, though, is the quality of their ingredients. You can taste the difference with each spoonful – the creamy texture, the intense flavors, the perfect balance of sweetness. I particularly enjoyed their seasonal specials; the pumpkin spice flavor was a revelation! And don't even get me started on their handmade waffle cones – absolute perfection. Whether you're craving a classic scoop or feeling adventurous, iScream has something for everyone. Trust me, you won't be disappointed!" - Gideon DeViller
