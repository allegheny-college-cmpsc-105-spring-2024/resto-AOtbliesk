"iScream is an absolute gem! From the moment you step inside, you're greeted with warmth and a mouthwatering aroma that promises a delightful experience ahead. The variety of flavors is truly impressive, catering to every palate imaginable. I couldn't resist trying the classic favorites like chocolate fudge and vanilla bean, but I also ventured into more adventurous territory with their unique creations like lavender honey and salted caramel pretzel. Each scoop was rich, creamy, and bursting with flavor. The staff were friendly and knowledgeable, offering recommendations and samples to help me find my perfect match. Whether you're a die-hard ice cream enthusiast or just looking for a sweet treat to brighten your day, iScream is the place to be!"
